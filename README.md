Case study
Jamie at Adventure Works wants to improve the company’s product inventory file. This includes making the data easier to read and locate. You are part of the team creating the inventory for submission to a management review. You are familiarizing yourself with the content in the inventory file and decide to use the Sort feature to organize the data to suit your requirements.

Step 1: Download and customize the file
Download and Open the File
Download Adventure Works Inventory.xlsx and open it in Microsoft Excel.

The file contains one worksheet named Products, consisting of 151 rows and 9 columns.

Products worksheet with prefilled content. Not yet sorted.
 Add a Visual Marker

Before applying sorting techniques, add a visual marker to track how sorting affects row positions.

Select cells A32 to I32 (row 32 across all columns).

On the Home tab, locate the Font group.

Click the Fill Color (paint bucket) icon and choose Yellow.

Purpose: This helps you track whether the sorting operation is working as expected.

Step 2: Performing alpha-numeric sorts
View the data organized by Product Name in ascending order.

Tip: Don’t forget to have the cursor in the correct column before selecting the Sort choice. Also, don’t forget that Undo will reverse a sort if you’ve made an error. Monitor the position of the colored row to ensure that the sort is working as you expect.

Sort the data by Product Name in descending order.  Keyboard Shortcut: Press Alt + D + S to open the Sort dialog box and customize sorting options.

Sort the data by Date Entered so that the oldest entry is at the top.  Keyboard Shortcut: Press Alt + D + S, choose "Date Entered" as the column, and select "Oldest to Newest."

Tip: Excel stores dates as numbers, so this will be a numeric sort.

Sort the data by Supplier using the shortcut Sort Ascending button. Press Alt + H + S + A (Home → Sort & Filter → Sort A to Z).

Apply a sort that sorts the data by Supplier in ascending order and then by Units in Stock in descending order. Keyboard Shortcut: Press Alt + D + S, then manually set up multi-level sorting.

Tip: Remember the Sort choice in the data ribbon.

Reverse this sort using the Undo feature. Press Ctrl + Z immediately to undo the last action.

Conclusion
You have helped Adventure Works to re-organize its product inventory file using the Sort feature in Microsoft Excel. The Sort feature in Microsoft Excel can help you to reorganize data in many ways. By using these sorting techniques, you can work more efficiently and quickly with large worksheets.
